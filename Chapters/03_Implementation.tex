\section{Problem Statement and Motivation}

The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in enterprise applications has created an unprecedented demand for efficient, scalable, and maintainable integration architectures. While the theoretical capabilities of LLMs are well-documented, the practical implementation of these models within enterprise systems presents significant architectural challenges that remain inadequately addressed in current literature.

Contemporary enterprise applications require LLM integration patterns that can simultaneously satisfy multiple competing requirements: low-latency response times for interactive applications, high-throughput processing for batch operations, real-time streaming capabilities for conversational interfaces, and comprehensive observability for production monitoring. The existing body of research predominantly focuses on model performance optimization and theoretical integration approaches, leaving a critical gap in empirical, production-ready implementation studies.

The fundamental challenge lies in the architectural decision-making process when selecting appropriate integration patterns. Traditional REST APIs, while well-understood and widely adopted, may not be optimal for LLM workloads that exhibit unique characteristics such as variable processing times, context-dependent responses, and resource-intensive computations. Emerging protocols like Model Context Protocol (MCP) promise improved efficiency through persistent connections and stateful interactions, yet lack comprehensive empirical validation in real-world scenarios. Similarly, streaming protocols offer real-time user feedback but introduce complexity in error handling, resource management, and system observability.

Furthermore, the enterprise software development community faces a methodological challenge: the absence of standardized benchmarking frameworks and quantitative evaluation criteria for LLM integration patterns. This deficiency impedes evidence-based architectural decisions and limits the reproducibility of performance studies. The complexity is compounded by the need to balance theoretical performance advantages with practical implementation constraints, including development complexity, operational overhead, and maintainability considerations.

The motivation for this research emerges from the recognition that current literature fails to provide actionable guidance for enterprise architects and developers who must make critical decisions about LLM integration patterns. The gap between theoretical protocol specifications and practical implementation realities necessitates a comprehensive, empirical study that bridges this divide through rigorous scientific methodology and production-ready implementations.

    \caption{High-level system architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Layered Architecture Pattern Implementation}

The application implements a modified layered architecture that separates integration pattern concerns from core LLM processing logic. This design enables fair comparison between patterns by ensuring that the underlying model inference remains identical across all integration approaches.

% TODO: Add reference to controller implementation
The controller layer provides pattern-specific HTTP endpoints while delegating to specialized service implementations. This separation ensures that HTTP handling overhead is consistently measured across all patterns while enabling pattern-specific optimizations.

% TODO: Add reference to LlmService.java (lines 1-150)

\end{figure}

\section{Design Patterns and Architectural Decisions}

The architectural design incorporates several strategic design patterns that support the research objectives while ensuring enterprise-grade implementation quality. Each pattern selection was driven by specific research requirements and validated through empirical testing.

\subsection{Strategy Pattern for Integration Pattern Abstraction}

The implementation employs the Strategy pattern to encapsulate integration pattern-specific behavior while maintaining a consistent interface for performance measurement. Each integration service (\texttt{RestLlmService}, \texttt{McpLlmService}, \texttt{StreamingLlmService}) implements pattern-specific processing logic while delegating core LLM inference to the shared \texttt{LlmService}.

This pattern enables the precise measurement of pattern-specific overhead by isolating integration logic from core processing. The consistent delegation pattern ensures that timing measurements capture only the architectural differences between patterns, supporting accurate comparative analysis.

\subsection{Template Method Pattern for Request Processing}

The request processing flow implements a Template Method pattern that standardizes timing measurement and data persistence across all integration patterns. The template ensures consistent measurement points while allowing pattern-specific customization of processing logic.

% TODO: Add reference to service layer implementation (lines 30-80 in each service class)
The template implementation provides standardized pre-processing, processing, and post-processing hooks. This design ensures that performance measurements are collected at identical points in the processing pipeline, eliminating measurement variability that could compromise research validity.

\subsection{Observer Pattern for Real-time Monitoring}

The monitoring infrastructure implements an Observer pattern that enables real-time metrics collection without coupling the core processing logic to specific monitoring backends. The \texttt{MetricsService} implements scheduled observation of system metrics and application performance indicators.

% TODO: Add reference to MetricsService.java (lines 25-120)
This pattern provides comprehensive observability while maintaining measurement accuracy by ensuring that monitoring overhead remains consistent across all integration patterns. The scheduled collection approach eliminates the potential for monitoring-induced performance artifacts.

\subsection{Factory Pattern for Configuration Management}

The configuration management architecture employs a Factory pattern for creating properly configured model parameters and inference settings. This pattern ensures consistent model configuration across all integration patterns while enabling centralized parameter tuning for research optimization.

The factory implementation provides deterministic configuration that eliminates variability from model parameter differences. This design choice ensures that measured performance differences reflect integration pattern characteristics rather than configuration inconsistencies.

\subsection{Circuit Breaker Pattern for Resilience}

The architecture incorporates resilience patterns essential for production deployment while maintaining measurement accuracy. The error handling implementation provides graceful degradation without compromising timing measurements.

The resilience patterns ensure that experimental measurements reflect realistic operational conditions while preventing cascading failures that could compromise research data collection. This design choice supports the research objective of providing enterprise-applicable findings.

\subsection{Dependency Injection for Testability and Measurement}

The comprehensive use of Spring's dependency injection framework provides several research benefits. First, it enables precise control over component initialization timing, ensuring that measurement artifacts from construction overhead are eliminated. Second, it facilitates the injection of measurement infrastructure without coupling core business logic to monitoring concerns.

The injection patterns support sophisticated testing scenarios while maintaining clean separation between business logic and measurement infrastructure. This architectural decision enables comprehensive unit testing and integration testing that validates both functional correctness and measurement accuracy.

% TODO: Add Figure 2.3: Design Pattern Interaction Diagram

\subsection{Architectural Trade-off Analysis}

Several critical architectural decisions required careful trade-off analysis to balance research objectives with implementation practicality. The decision to implement all integration patterns within a single application, rather than separate microservices, prioritizes measurement consistency over deployment flexibility. This choice ensures that environmental factors (JVM warmup, system resource availability, network conditions) remain constant across pattern comparisons.

The choice to implement custom metrics collection rather than relying solely on Spring Boot's built-in metrics reflects the need for LLM-specific measurement capabilities. While this increases implementation complexity, it provides the granular measurement capabilities essential for meaningful research findings.

The architecture's emphasis on synchronous processing for measurement collection, despite the availability of async alternatives, prioritizes measurement accuracy over theoretical performance optimization. This design choice ensures that timing measurements are not affected by the variability inherent in asynchronous metrics collection systems.

These architectural decisions collectively create a research platform that balances scientific rigor with practical enterprise applicability, supporting both immediate research objectives and future extensibility for advanced LLM integration scenarios.

\chapter{Scientific Testing and Benchmarking Framework}

\section{Overview}

The research implements a comprehensive scientific testing and benchmarking framework designed to evaluate and compare the performance characteristics of three distinct LLM integration patterns: REST, Model Context Protocol (MCP), and Streaming protocols. The framework employs a multi-layered approach combining controlled experimentation, real-time monitoring, and statistical analysis to ensure reproducible and statistically significant results.

\section{Framework Architecture}

\subsection{Data Collection and Persistence Layer}

The framework utilizes a dual-entity data model for comprehensive metrics collection:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{LlmRequest Entity}: Captures individual request-level metrics including processing time, token count, integration pattern, and temporal information with microsecond precision
    \item \textbf{ModelMetrics Entity}: Aggregates system-level performance indicators including latency statistics, throughput measurements, CPU utilization, and memory consumption patterns
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Real-Time Metrics Collection System}

The framework implements an automated metrics collection service (\texttt{MetricsService}) that operates on a fixed 60-second interval, providing:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Temporal Windowing}: Analyzes requests within sliding one-minute windows for consistent comparative analysis
    \item \textbf{Pattern-Based Grouping}: Segregates performance data by integration pattern (REST, MCP, STREAMING) for independent evaluation
    \item \textbf{Statistical Aggregation}: Computes comprehensive descriptive statistics including mean, variance, and distribution characteristics
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Benchmarking Controller}

A dedicated benchmarking endpoint (\texttt{BenchmarkController}) provides specialized testing capabilities:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Async Overhead Measurement}: Quantifies the pure computational overhead introduced by asynchronous processing patterns through controlled micro-benchmarks
    \item \textbf{Iterative Testing}: Supports configurable iteration counts (default: 100-1000 iterations) for statistical significance
    \item \textbf{Precision Timing}: Utilizes nanosecond-precision timing (\texttt{System.nanoTime()}) for accurate overhead quantification
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Multi-Protocol Testing Scripts}

The framework includes three distinct testing methodologies:

\subsubsection{Sequential Testing (test-simple.ps1)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Executes controlled sequential requests across all three integration patterns
    \item Provides baseline performance measurements under minimal system load
    \item Ensures consistent testing conditions for comparative analysis
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Load Testing (test-load.ps1)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implements concurrent request execution using PowerShell job parallelization
    \item Simulates realistic enterprise load conditions with configurable request volumes
    \item Tests system behavior under concurrent access patterns
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Comprehensive Thesis Benchmarking (thesis-benchmark.ps1)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Integrates async overhead measurements with practical performance testing
    \item Calculates theoretical performance improvements by isolating infrastructure overhead
    \item Provides statistical analysis including percentage improvements and overhead impact assessments
\end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Custom Metrics Exposure}: Real-time Prometheus gauges for latency, throughput, CPU, and memory metrics
    \item \textbf{Pattern-Specific Monitoring}: Dedicated metrics streams for each integration pattern
    \item \textbf{5-Second Scrape Intervals}: High-frequency data collection for temporal analysis
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Spring Boot Actuator}
