However, MCP demonstrates \textbf{13.0\% better consistency} in streaming performance, indicating more predictable behavior despite lower average performance.

\subsubsection{Protocol Performance Characteristics: A Nuanced Analysis}

The experimental results reveal a \textbf{nuanced protocol performance profile}:

\textbf{Traditional Request-Response:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item REST: 5,849ms (baseline)
    \item MCP: 4,468ms (-23.61\% improvement)
    \item \textbf{Result}: MCP wins significantly in single-request scenarios
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Streaming Scenarios:}

    \item MCP: 6,241ms (+8.94\% overhead)
    \item \textbf{Result}: REST wins in streaming scenarios
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Analysis}: This pattern demonstrates that \textbf{protocol efficiency varies significantly by implementation maturity and use case}. MCP's theoretical advantages in streaming may be offset by implementation complexity, while its optimization for request-response patterns delivers substantial performance gains.

\section{Discussion of Results}

\subsection{Performance Trade-offs in Different Scenarios}

The results reveal a sophisticated performance profile for MCP that depends significantly on the application pattern:

\textbf{Traditional Request-Response Scenarios:}
The 23.61\% performance improvement in traditional request-response patterns demonstrates that MCP's architectural optimizations and protocol efficiency provide substantial benefits for single-request operations. This significant advantage suggests that MCP's design effectively addresses the overhead typically associated with stateless HTTP interactions.

\textbf{Streaming Scenarios:}
Conversely, MCP experiences an 8.94\% performance penalty in streaming scenarios, while maintaining 13.0\% better consistency. This indicates that while the current MCP streaming implementation has optimization opportunities, it provides more predictable performance characteristics.

\subsection{Protocol Performance Characteristics}

A key finding is the \textbf{contrasting protocol performance characteristics} between traditional and streaming scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Single Requests}: MCP outperforms REST by 23.61\%
    \item \textbf{Streaming Operations}: REST outperforms MCP by 8.94\%
\end{itemize}

This pattern demonstrates that \textbf{protocol efficiency is implementation and use-case dependent}, supporting the thesis argument that specialized protocols like MCP excel in their optimized scenarios while requiring careful implementation in others.

\subsection{Streaming Consistency and Implementation Maturity}

MCP's most notable advantage appears in streaming consistency, with a 13.0\% improvement in performance variance despite lower average performance. This suggests that MCP's architectural approach provides more predictable performance characteristics, which is critical for user experience in interactive applications.

The performance differences also highlight the importance of implementation maturity:
\begin{itemize}
    \item REST's streaming advantage reflects mature HTTP/SSE implementations
    \item MCP's traditional request-response advantage demonstrates effective optimization in that domain
    \item Both protocols show room for optimization in different scenarios
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Network Efficiency Patterns}

The network overhead analysis shows different patterns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Traditional scenarios: 60.8\% reduction in network overhead (51ms vs 20ms) favoring MCP
    \item Streaming scenarios: Implementation-dependent efficiency patterns
    \item Overall: MCP shows superior network efficiency in single-request scenarios
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scalability Implications for Different Application Types}

The minimal async overhead (0.087ms) becomes negligible when amortized across LLM operations, suggesting that MCP's approach scales effectively without significant per-operation penalties. However, the performance characteristics suggest different optimal use cases:

\textbf{MCP Optimization Scenarios:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Single-request applications requiring fast response times
    \item Applications where consistency is more important than raw speed
    \item Scenarios requiring sophisticated protocol features
\end{itemize}

\textbf{REST Optimization Scenarios:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item High-throughput streaming applications
    \item Systems leveraging mature HTTP infrastructure
    \item Applications prioritizing streaming performance over request-response efficiency
\end{itemize}

\section{Limitations and Future Work}

\subsection{Current Implementation Limitations}

\begin{enumerate}
